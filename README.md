by Saikrupa Purushothaman

## **Introduction**

In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers. It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. This case study is to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

## **Objective**

Objective of the case study is to

- evaluate multiple models and predict if a high value customer will churn or not
- Calculate other relevant metrics for the evaluated models
- Identify the most important features
- Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.

## Dataset

Two sets of data has been provided for this case study.
train.csv - This is the data to be used to train the model
test.csv - This is the unseen data that will be used to test the model
